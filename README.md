## Project Name: Payment Gateway Backend

### Project Overview:

This project is a payment gateway system built using NestJS, TypeScript, Express, gRPC, Redis, PostgreSQL, and GraphQL. It provides a modular and scalable architecture to handle user authentication, authorization, fraud detection, currency conversion, payment methods, and communication via Kafka.

### Tech Stack:

1. **NestJS:** A progressive Node.js framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications.

2. **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

3. **Express:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used as the underlying web server in NestJS.

4. **gRPC:** A high-performance RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework that enables efficient communication between microservices.

5. **Redis:** An in-memory data structure store used as a caching layer for quick data retrieval.

6. **PostgreSQL:** A powerful open-source relational database management system, chosen for persisting user and payment data.

7. **GraphQL:** A query language and runtime for APIs, providing a flexible and efficient alternative to traditional REST APIs.

8. **Docker:** A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers, ensuring consistent deployment across different environments.

9. **Kafka:** A distributed event streaming platform used for asynchronous communication between different parts of the application.

10. **RabbitMQ:** A message broker that enables communication between microservices and supports different messaging patterns.

11. **Passport:** A middleware for handling user authentication strategies in Node.js applications.

12. **Bcrypt:** A library for hashing and salting passwords, enhancing security for user authentication.

13. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties, commonly used for authentication.

### Project Structure:

- **/src:** Main source code directory.
  - **/auth:** User authentication and authorization module.
  - **/fraud:** Fraud detection module.
  - **/currency:** Currency conversion module.
  - **/payment-method:** Payment method module.
  - **/user:** User-related functionality (entity, service, controller).
  - **/payment:** Payment processing functionality (entity, service, controller).
  - **/kafka:** Kafka service for event-driven communication.
  - **/oauth:** OAuth module for external authentication.
  - **/common:** Shared configurations and utilities.

- **/graphql:** GraphQL-related files and modules.
- **/grpc:** gRPC-related files and modules.
- **/docker:** Docker configuration files.

### Usage:

1. Clone the repository:
